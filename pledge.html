Instead of fully removing humans from the process completely, a domain expert can be requested to verify some of the results from the model to ensure the performance is aligned with the objectives.</p>
                                    <p>Often a partial automation (i.e. having 3 people instead of 50 performing a specific process) may still have significant value, and provide an extra layer of safety.</p>

However, when reasonable, it may be required to perform the deployment of the system with a human-in-the-loop review in place. The system's precision and recall can then be evaluated during a production period, and full automation may be performed once it is reasonable</p>

                        <p>However, technologists should not focus on how ethics or morals can be embedded in the algorithms themselves.

                        <p>Given that the implications of the bias identified are specific to the domain, and use-case of the technology, technologists should be able to create, identify and explain the bias in the data, so the right processes can be put in place to mitigate potential risks<p>

It is critical to ensure reasonable effort is invested from technologists to understand, evaluate and document potential biases on data, as opposed to trying to add the morals/ethics on the algorithms themselves.</p>
                                    <p>Technologists should focus on explaining and documenting the findings so the right metrics can be defined for an acceptable performance in production define what the metrics for acceptable performance should be for a model to be deployed in production. Similarly, there are situations where full automation is too risky, and a human-in-the-loop design is most suitable as per <a href="#commitment-1">commitment #1</a>.</p>

                        <p>With the deep learning hype, technologists often throw large amounts of data into complex ML pipelines hoping something will work without caring about inner functionality. However technologists should invest reasonable efforts where necessary to continuously improve tools and process that allow them to explain results based on features and models chosen.</p>
                        <p>It is possible to use different tools and approaches to make models more explainable, such as by adding domain knowledge through features themselves instead of just allowing deep/complex models to infer them. </p>
                        <p>Even though on certain situations accuracy may decrease, the transparency and explainability gains may be significant.</p>

									<h3>Explainability through feature importance</h3>
                                    <p>Often the challenge of explainability can be simplified by reducing the scope of what needs to be explainable. In some occasions, it is possible to increase explainability of the model by analysing the features and inference results.</p>
                                    <p>Getting a better understanding on the importance of each feature on each result would enable technologists to explain the model itself. There are several tools that can help for this, including <a href="https://ai.googleblog.com/2018/09/the-what-if-tool-code-free-probing-of.html">Tensorboard's What-if Screen</a>, as well as <a href="https://github.com/slundberg/shap">"SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations)"</a> which allow for understanding of the effect of features.</p>

                                    <h3>Domain Knowledge to increase Explainability</h3>
                                    <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Um7grgYdBQQ">Bons.ai has a great insight on explainability</a> that shows how it is possible to introduce explainability even in very complex models by introducing domain knowledge.</p>
                                    <p>Deep learning models are able to identify and abstract complex patterns that humans may not be able to see in data. However, there are many situations where introducing a-priori expert domain knowledge into the features, or abstracting key patterns identified in the deep learning models as actual features, it would be possible to break down the model into subsequent, more explainable pieces. </p>

									<h3>Abstracting Each Computational Step</h3>
                                    <p>In order to make a machine learning model reproducible, it is necessary to abstract its constituent components: namely 1) data, 2) configuration/environment, and 3) computational graph. If all these three points are abstracted, it is possible to have reproducibility of that specific computation.</p>
                                    <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eOzl-LFqYFM">Pachyderm has an excellent breakdown of how to abstract each computational step</a> together with its components. This provides a transparent and compliant environment for machine learning in development and production.</p>

                                    <p>There are multiple formats for trained machine learning models - the most popular include: <a href="https://onnx.ai/"> Open Neural Network Exchange Format</a>, <a href="https://www.khronos.org/nnef">Neural Network Exchange Format</a>, and <a href="http://dmg.org/">Predictive Model Markup Language</a></p>

									<h3>Processes to Reduce Impact</h3>
                                    <p>There are currently a lot of articles covering the jobs being automated by AI (e.g. assembly line workers, field technicians, call center workers, etc), as well as technical articles providing insights on how to deploy machine learning models across production systems.</p>
                                    <p>However it's often forgotten about the importance the individuals in the midst of that automation. Fortunately business change has existed for a long time, and currently startups have been partnering with delivery partners such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Three_%28management_consultancies%29">the Big Three Management Consultancy</a> firms. It is important for technologists to understand their potential impact, and subsequently the actions that can be taken to mitigate the impact</p>

									<h3>AI Business Change Strategies</h3>
                                    <p>When planning the rollout of a new technology to automate a process, there is a number of people who's role or at least responsibilities will be automated. If this is not taken into consideration, these people will not have a transition plan, which would affect overall performance.</p>
                                    <p>Technologists should make sure they are able to raise the relevant concerns when business change or operational transformation plans are being set up, as this would make a significant positive impact in the rollout of the technology. For this, startups are starting to partner with digital transformation and management consulting companies to co-deliver large-scale deployments</p>

									<h3>Jevon's Paradox</h3>
                                    <p>A very interesting concept relevant to the current state of AI is Jevon's paradox. This paradox basically talks about how during the industrial revolution, innovations allowed for machines to perform the same output with less coal consumption.</p>
                                    <p>Intuitively, it was thought that this would mean that the total coal required to power the industry would decrease. What happened instead is that given the cost to perform the same action decreased and got commoditised, more demand arose and the total coal consumption to power the industry actually increased. Analogous to this could be the rise of Excel, and in some areas, the rise of AI.</p>
