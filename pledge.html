                        <p>With the deep learning and machine learning hype, it may be tempting to always throw large amounts of data into complex machine learning pipelines, however technologists should ensure there is a fundamental understanding and ability to explain the results based on features and models chosen.</p>
                        <p>It is possible to use different tools and approaches to make models more explainable, such as by adding domain knowledge through features themselves - although on certain situations accuracy may decrease, the transparency and explainability gains may be significant.</p>

						<p>Autonomous decision-making systems open the doors to new potential security breaches.</p>
                        <p>More importantly, it is critical to be aware that most security breaches occur due to human error as opposed to actual hacks (i.e. someone sending the dataset attached in an email by accident, or losing their laptop/phone)</p>
                        <p>Nevertheless, it is important to make sure we prepare for both through explicit efforts to educate relevant personel, establish relevant processes around data, and assess implications of ML backdoors (such as adversarial attacks).</p>
