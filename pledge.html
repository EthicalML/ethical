                                    <p>It is up to the technologist to be able to define what the metrics for acceptable performance should be for a model to be deployed in production. Likewise, it will be important for our fellow developers to frown upon bad practices in this, as we would do when a developer doesn't add unit tests.</p>

									<h3>AI Business Change Strateges</h3>
                                    <p>When planning the rollout of a new technology to automate a process, there is a number of people who's role or at least responsibilities will be automated. If this is not taken into consideration, these people will not have a transition plan, which would affect overall performance.</p>
                                    <p>Technologists should make sure the right business change or operational transformation plans are set up-front, as this would make a significant positive impact in the rollout of the technology. For this, startups are starting to partner with digital transformation and management consulting companies to co-deliver large-scale deployments</p>

									<h3>Jevon's Paradox</h3>
                                    <p>A very interesting concept relevant to the current state of AI is Jevon's paradox. This paradox basically talks about how during the industrial revolution, innovations allowed for machines to perform the same output with less coal consumption.</p>
                                    <p>Intuitively, it was thought that this would mean that the total coal required to power the industry would decrease. What happened instead is that given the cost to perform the same action decreased and got commoditised, more demand arised and the total coal consumption to power the industry actually increased. Analogous to this could be the rise of Excel, and in some areas, the rise of AI.</p>

                                    <p>It is not uncommon for teams to get stuck on default accuracy targets, doing everything possible to increase percentages naively. It is important to go beyond accuracy, and understand the performance of the model.</p>
                                    <p>There is a large toolbox that can be used to benefit, including the core fundamentals, including precision, recall, F1-score, learning curves, error bars, confusion matrices and beyond. Technologists should make sure they understand and apply the fundamentals at all times.</p>

                                    <p>More specifically, understanding the impact of False Positives, False Negatives, defining an F-1 score metric, defining the cost functions to evaluate the model and building the right analysis curves should be a top priority.</p>

                        <p>With the deep learning and machine learning hype, it may be tempting to always throw large amounts of data into complex machine learning pipelines, however technologists should ensure there is a fundamental understanding and ability to explain the results based on features and models chosen.</p>
                        <p>It is possible to use different tools and approaches to make models more explainable, such as by adding domain knowledge through features themselves - although on certain situations accuracy may decrease, the transparency and explainability gains may be significant.</p>

									<h3>Complex Models for Exploration</h3>
                                    <p>Currently there is a lot of great work being done in deep learning, however the tradeoff of complex models comes with an explainability tradeoff. Sometimes there is no other option but to use these models, but often it is possible to challenge this tradeoff.</p>

                        <p>Often production machine learning systems don' t have the capabilities to diagnose effectively when something bad happens with a model - let alone, reproduce the same results.</p>
                        <p> In production systems, it is important to perform standard procedures, such as reverting a model to a previous version, or reproducing an input to debug a specific functionality</p>
                        <p>Fortunately there is a lot of great work around reproducibility in data science, including various ways to build audit trails, store computational graphs, store data as it is transformed through a pipeline, etc. which should be adopted to have reasonable level of reproducibility.</p>
