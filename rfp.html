<hr>
<h3 class="western">0.1 - Overview</h3>
<p>The “AI Request for Proposal v1.0” is part of the <a href="https://ethical.institue/rfx.html">AI-RFX
Procurement Framework</a>. The objective of this document is to
empower industry practitioners looking to procure AI systems. It
should serve as a guide and a reference when putting together a
tender or when procuring a machine learning solution. This template
should also serve as a guide for suppliers that are looking to put
together a proposal for a machine learning solution. This way
suppliers can ensure they are following best practices in responsible
machine learning development. 
</p>

<p>This AI-RFP template has been built using our “Machine Learning
Maturity Model” as its core, which is <a href="https://ethical.institute/rfx.html#model">available
for download</a> at our website. The “Machine Learning Maturity
Model” goes beyond the machine learning algorithms themselves, and
provides an assessment criteria to evaluate the maturity of the
infrastructure and processes around the algorithms. The concept of
“Maturity” is not just defined as a matter of technical
excellence, scientific rigor, and robust products. It also
essentially involves responsible innovation and development
processes, with sensitivity to the relevant domains of expert
knowledge and consideration of all relevant direct and indirect
stakeholders. 
</p>

<p>All the frameworks under the AI-RFX Procurement Framework,
including the “AI Request for Proposal”, the “Machine Learning
Maturity Model”, and the “AI Tender Competition” templates have
been released as <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ecJPiCAc0EkAbU_L5f2yxgucAfThynQLc1Qn37jR4Gg/edit#heading=h.5o0sbykhosr6">fully
open source</a>. This allows suppliers and companies to contribute
and update these templates, helping raise the bar for AI safety,
quality and performance.

Motivation
<img src="images/MLENG-3.png" name="Image1" width="500" height="500" border="0" style="float:right" align="bottom">
</h3>
<p>There is currently a growing number of companies that are working
towards introducing machine learning systems to automate critical
processes at scale. This has required the “productisation” of
machine learning models, which introduces new complexities. This
complexity revolves around a new set of roles that fall under the
umbrella of “Machine Learning Engineering”. This new set of roles
fall in &nbsp;the intersection between DevOps, data science and
software engineering.</p>

<br style="clear: both">
<img src="images/MLENG-4.png" name="Image2" width="500" height="500" style="float:left" border="0" align="bottom">
<p><br>
</p>
<p>To make things harder, the deployment of machine learning
solutions in industry introduces an even bigger complexity. This
involves the intersection of the new abstract “Machine Learning
Engineering” roles, together with the industry domain experts and
policy makers.</p>

<p>Because of this, there is a strong need to set the AI &amp; ML
standards, so practitioners are empowered to raise the bar for
safety, quality and performance around AI solutions. The AI-RFX
Procurement Framework aims to achieve the first steps towards
this.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
</p>

<h3 class="western">0.4 - How to use this document</h3>
<h4 class="western">0.4.1 - Using as reference</h4>
<p>Many procurement managers may already own internally-approved RFP
templates or RFP portals with standard entries. If that is the case,
this document can be treated as a reference to obtain insights from
key sections specific to machine learning, such as “<a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ecJPiCAc0EkAbU_L5f2yxgucAfThynQLc1Qn37jR4Gg/edit#heading=h.lqzrc25boiog">Chapter
3: Tender Process</a>” and “<a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ecJPiCAc0EkAbU_L5f2yxgucAfThynQLc1Qn37jR4Gg/edit#heading=h.84prvsfhx8jz">Chapter
4: Detailed Scope</a>”. The machine learning specific sections in
this document include:</p>
<ul>
	<li>
<p ><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ecJPiCAc0EkAbU_L5f2yxgucAfThynQLc1Qn37jR4Gg/edit#heading=h.3498ud5xwm8">2.5

	- Required service levels</a></p>
</li></ul>
<h4 class="western">0.4.2 - Structure</h4>
<p>The document consists of multiple chapters, each chapter with a
set of sections. The text in the sections is meant to be replaced
completely, and it consist of:</p>
<ul>
	<li>
<p >An explanation of what the
	section should contain</p>
	</li><li>
<p >An example of what it the
	section could look like</p>
</li></ul>
<h4 class="western">0.4.3 - Example</h4>
<p>Each section has an example. The example is consistent throughout
the document, and it is around a fictitious company called
“Manufacturing Group Limited”. The objective is to provide a
broad and generic example that covers multiple useful areas which
companies can relate to. In this specific example, the company is
looking for a machine learning system that performs predictive
maintenance and data analysis automation on a fictitious end-to-end
internal process.</p>
<h4 class="western">0.4.4 - When to use</h4>
<p>This template is relevant primarily for the procurement of machine
learning systems, and hence it is only relevant when looking to
automate a process that involves data analysis that is too complex to
be tackled using simple RPA tools or rule-based systems. 
</p>
<hr>
<h3 class="western">0.5 - Template vs Reality</h3>
<p>This document should serve as a guide. Especially for smaller
projects, the level of detail required may vary significantly, and
some sections can be left out as required. This template attempts to
to provide a high level overview on each chapter (and respective
sections) so the procurement manager and suppliers can provide as
much content as reasonable. 
</p>

<p>Each company putting together a procurement process will have
different set of requirements, and unfortunately this is not a
“one-size-fits-all” document. The main purpose of this document
is to raise the bar both in industry and technology, and provide key
industry stakeholders with a solid basis to start from. Also, it’s
free.</p>
<hr>
<h3 class="western" >0.6 - Open
Source License - Free as in freedom</h3>
<h4 class="western">0.6.1 - Open source License</h4>
<p>This document is open source, which means that it can be updated
by the community. The motivation to release this as open source is so
that it is continuously improved by the community. This will ensure
that the standards for safety, quality and performance of what is
expected in machine learning systems will keep increasing, whilst
being kept in check on a realistic level by both suppliers and
companies.</p>
<h4 class="western">0.6.2 - Contributing.md</h4>
<p>The Institute for Ethical AI &amp; Machine Learning’s AI-RFX
committee is in charge of the contributing community for all of the

Requirements Overview</h2>
<p>The objective of this chapter is not to propose the solution
desired, but to provide details on the end-to-end process and/or
challenge identified within the company. As mentioned in the
introduction, given that this RFP is specific to machine learning
solutions, the ideal way to explain the challenge/process is through
the flow of data across the entire process, including
transformations, stakeholders involved, systems, and data-sources.
This is because machine learning solutions are used to automate the
analysis of data, and hence this would provide suppliers with a good
understanding on all the steps that surround the data itself.</p>

<p>This chapter has been put together using the <a href="https://ethical.institute/rfx.html#model">Machine
Learning Maturity Model</a> assessment criteria. Each section takes
into consideration each of the criteria implicitly. It is recommended
to take into consideration all the 8 assessment criteria when putting
together this section.</p>
<hr>
<h3 class="western">2.1 - Key objectives &amp; outcomes</h3>
<p>This section is one of the most important in this chapter. This
section should provide a high level overview of what are the tangible

<h3 class="western">2.2 - Process/challenge overview</h3>
<p>This section should contain a concise and high level description
of the process / challenge that the organisation has identified which
needs to be automated or improved. As mentioned at the beginning of
the chapter, the overview should focus on the flow of the data across
the steps throughout process. Once again, the reason for this is
because machine learning use-cases in industry are for (full or
partial) automation of data analysis -- whether for business insights
or process automation.</p>

<p>Providing in-depth information on the current flow of data will
allow suppliers to use their expertise to how and to what extent
their solution will be able to automate the process, whether full or
partial automation. 
</p>

<p>The key questions that should be covered in this section include:</p>
<ul>
	<li>
<p >What are the data-sets and
	data-sources involved in the process?</p>
	</li><li>
<p >Who are the stakeholders
	involved?</p>

<p >What are the

<p >What are the inefficiencies

benchmarks, however it is possible to relax constraints to obtain
higher level metrics that would still be useful for suppliers. The
example in this section provides an overview of some metrics that can
be collected. This section is directly addressed in “Assessment

<p>(*) Accuracy metrics</p>
<p>As it is mentioned in the Machine Learning Maturity Model, it is
critical to consider what practical accuracy metrics make sense for
each project. Often projects consider only simple accuracy (i.e.
number of correct cases / total number of cases). However it is often
necessary to take into consideration what types of errors are the
most critical in the specific project. Some of these considerations
include:</p>
<ul>
	<li>
<p >A case that should have

<h2 class="western" >3 - Tender
Process</h2>
<p>This chapter introduces suppliers to the end-to-end tender process
that they will have to go through during procurement. This chapter
has been put together using the <a href="https://ethical.institute/rfx.html#model">Machine
Learning Maturity Model</a> assessment criteria. It is recommended to
take into consideration all the 8 assessment criteria when putting
together this section. Each section in this chapter takes into
consideration each of the criteria implicitly, and <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ecJPiCAc0EkAbU_L5f2yxgucAfThynQLc1Qn37jR4Gg/edit#heading=h.856p9h8sb15f">Section

<p>This section should have the contact details of the person or
people that are in charge of the day to day communications for this
project. This ideally will be an individual that is well connected
with the relevant stakeholders in the organisation. At the same time,
it has to be someone that will have the time to dedicate to perform
the delivery, communications and internal championing of the
solution. 
</p>

<p>If the key point of contact is not able to engage internally or
externally in an efficient way for any reason (whether not enough
time committed, not enough resources or slow response from other
departments) the success of the project may be affected. It is
critical that the key point of contact and the team are able to work
closely together as necessary for the project.</p>

<p>This chapter has been put together using the <a href="https://ethical.institute/rfx.html#model">Machine
Learning Maturity Model</a> assessment criteria. Each section takes
into consideration each of the criteria implicitly. It is recommended
to take into consideration all the 8 assessment criteria when putting
together this section.</p>
<hr>
<h3 class="western">4.1 - Competition</h3>
<p>This section contains the instructions, documentation and datasets
required for the suppliers to be able to carry out the competition.
It’s important that the competition is representative of the
challenge presented, and that it references the right areas in
“Chapter 2 - Our Process”, in order for suppliers to get complete
context.</p>

<p>The details to put together a strong competition for suppliers are
covered in the <a href="https://ethical.institute/rfx.html#competition">“AI
Competition Tender” template</a> which can be downloaded from the
website. However, below there is a high-level process outlined on how
competitions can be set up.</p>

<p>In summary, the generic process required to prepare a competition
for a machine learning system, it requires the following steps:</p>
<ol>
	<li>
<p >For the end-to-end process,
	identify the datasets used (as outlined in chapter 2)</p>
	<ol>
		<li>
<p >For more complex
		challenges, you will require more examples</p>
	</li></ol>
	</li><li>
<p >Identify the final insights
	or decisions that are inferred from these datasets</p>
	<ol>
		<li>
<p >This often requires manual
		work, as it’s important that the datasets come together with the
		answers that are expected to be predicted by the ML models</p>
	</li></ol>
	</li><li>
<p >Split the data into a TEST
	dataset, and an EVALUATION dataset</p>
	<ol>
		<li>
<p >Each contains the datasets
		and answers</p>
	</li></ol>
	</li><li>
<p >Give the TEST dataset to
	the suppliers so they build a machine learning model</p>
	</li><li>
<p >Evaluate the suppliers with
	the evaluation set</p>
</li></ol>

<p>There are key points that need to be taken into consideration,
including:</p>
<ul>
	<li>
<p >Evaluation metrics should
	go beyond accuracy (precision, recall, etc)</p>
	</li><li>
<p >The expertise required to
	operate the system</p>
	</li><li>
<p >The work required to get to
	that level of accuracy</p>
	</li><li>
<p >Access to domain experts as
	relevant for suppliers to obtain understanding on datasets and ways
	of analysing datasets</p>
</li></ul>

<p >Suppliers will be

				</li><li>
<p >We will provide a TEST

				EVALUATION dataset that will be provided without labels to
				evaluate performance</p>
				</li><li>
<p >Given that the machine
				data changes as time goes by, we are interested in systems that
				have functionality that allows for programmatic re-training, so
				we will expect the models to be evaluated on a 10-fold
				cross-validation.</p>
				</li><li>
<p >The datasets will
				contain information 40 sets of data, each referencing a machine
				evaluation process as outlined in “Chapter 2 - Our Process”.

<p >You can find further
				information about each dataset in the datasets provided</p>
			</li></ul>
			
			<p>Evaluation Metrics</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
<p >We expect metrics to be
				at least higher than our human benchmarks. This means that the
				accuracy should be no less than 80%</p>
				</li><li>
<p >A critical error in this
				case, is missing a machine that actually requires maintenance, so
				we expect suppliers to use recall as the most important metric</p>
				</li><li>
<p >Marking a machine as
				needing maintenance when it doesn’t is also expensive, so we
				expect suppliers to also give an insight on the precision of
				their model</p>

				as the EVALUATION dataset index.</p>
				</li><li>

<p>The reason why machine learning accuracy is not added in this
list, is because it is often too ambiguous to define an actual number
as an umbrella. Often the definition of the types of issue cover in
part the point of accuracy indirectly, as the system would become
non-functional if the accuracy decreases significantly. If there are
constraints in the SLA defined for accuracy, it should be approached
with care by both company and suppliers, as if not taken a high-level
approach, it may lead to a more brittle agreement that may affect
negatively the suppliers or the company (or both).</p>
