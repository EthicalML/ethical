										<h3>Raising the bar for AI safety, quality and performance in industry</h3>
										<p>The AI-RFX procurement framework has been put together by a group of domain experts. Its purpose is to ensure best practices in industry during the procurement, design, devleopment and deployment of machine learning systems in industry.</p>
                                        <p>This procurement framework goes beyond the machine learning algorithms. It provides a method to assess the maturity level of the technical infrastructure and processes around the algorithms themselves, by using our Machine Learning Maturity Model.</p>

										<h3 id="model">The Machine Learning Maturity Model</h3>
										<p>The Machine Learning Maturity Model is a set of criteria which ensures that the core technical infrastructure and the right processes are in place. It provides the ability for key industry practitioners to set a bar for quality, safety and performance when procuring machine learning solutions. You can request to download a copy of the AI-RFX Framework through <a href="#contact">the contact form below</a>, which contains this document as well.</p>
