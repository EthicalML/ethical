                                <p>The Company uses cookies to make interactions with the Company’s Web sites easy and meaningful. When you visit one of the Company’s Web sites, The Company’s servers send a cookie to your computer. Standing alone, cookies do not personally identify you. They merely recognize your Web browser. Unless you choose to identify yourself to The Company, either by responding to a promotional offer, opening an account, or filling out a Web form, you remain anonymous to the Company.</p>
                                <p>There are two types of cookies: session-based and persistent-based. Session cookies exist only during one session. They disappear from your computer when you close your browser software or turn off your computer. Persistent cookies remain on your computer after you close your browser or turn off your computer.</p>
                                <p>If you have chosen to identify yourself to The Company, the Company uses session cookies containing encrypted information to allow the Company to uniquely identify you.
